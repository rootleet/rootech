                <p>The Problem Solving process consists of a sequence of sections that fit together depending on the type of problem to be solved.</p>
                <p>
                    The process is only a guide for problem solving. It is useful to have a structure to follow to make sure that nothing is overlooked.
                    Nothing here is likely to be brand new to anyone, but it is the pure acknowledgement and reminding of the
                    process that can help the problems to be solved. These are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5><strong>Problem Definition</strong></h5>
                        <p>
                            At Rootech Inc, we initially involve defining the problem presented. You need to decide what you
                            want achieve and write it down. Often people keep the problem in their head as a vague idea and
                            can so often get lost in what they are trying to solve that no solution seems to fit. Merely
                            writing down the problem forces us to think about what we are actually trying to solve and how
                            much we want to achieve. The first part of the process does not only involves writing down the
                            problem to solve, but also checking that you are answering the right problem. It is a check-step
                            to ensure that we do not answer a side issue or only solve the part of the problem that is most
                            easy to solve. People often use the most immediate solution to the first problem definition that
                            they find without spending time checking the problem is the right one to answer.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5><strong>Problem Analysis</strong></h5>
                        <p>The next step in the process is often to check where we are, what is the current situation and
                            what is involved in making it a problem. For example, what are the benefits of the current
                            product/service/process? And why did we decide to make it like that? Understanding where the
                            problem is coming from, how it fits in with current developments and what the current environment
                            is, is crucial when working out whether a solution will actually work or not. Similarly you must
                            have a set of criteria by which to evaluate any new solutions or you will not know whether the
                            idea is workable or not. This section of the problem solving process ensures that time is spent
                            in stepping back and assessing the current situation and what actually needs to be changed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After this investigation, it is often good to go back one step to reconfirm that your problem
                            definition is still valid. Frequently after the investigation people discover that the problem
                            they really want to answer is very different from their original interpretation of it.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5><strong>Generating Possible Solutions</strong></h5>
                        <p>
                            When we have discovered the real problem that you want to solve and have investigated the climate
                            into which the solution must fit, the next stage is to generate a number of possible solutions.
                            At this stage we concentrate on generating many solutions and not evaluate them at all. Very often
                            an idea, which would have been discarded immediately, when evaluated properly, can be developed
                            into a superb solution. At this stage, we do not pre-judge any potential solutions but treat each
                            idea as a new idea in its own right and worthy of consideration.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5><strong>Analyzing The Solutions</strong></h5>
                        <p>
                            This section of the problem solving process is where we investigate the various factors about each
                            of the potential solutions. We note down the good and bad points and other things which are relevant
                            to each solution. Even at this stage we are not evaluating the solution because if we do so then
                            we could decide not to write down the valid good points about it because overall you think it will
                            not work. However wemight discover that by writing down its advantages that it has a totally unique
                            advantage. Only by discovering this might we choose to put the effort in to develop the idea so
                            that it will work.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5><strong>Selecting The Best Solution(s)</strong></h5>
                        <p>
                            This is the section where we look through the various influencing factors for each possible solution
                            and decide which solutions to keep and which to disregard. We look at the solution as a whole
                            and use our judgement as to whether to use the solution or not. In our Innovation Toolbox,
                            we vote using either a Yes/No/Interesting process or on a sliding scale depending on how good
                            the idea is. Sometimes pure facts and figures dictate which ideas will work and which will not.
                            In other situations, it will be purely feelings and intuition that decides. Remember that
                            intuition is really a lifetimes experience and judgement compressed into a single decision.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By voting for the solutions we will end up with a shortlist of potential solutions.
                            We may want to increase the depth in the analysis of each idea and vote again on
                            that shortlist to further refine your shortlist.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We will then end up with one, many or no viable solutions. In the case where we have no solutions
                            that work, we will need to repeat the generation of solutions section to discover more potential
                            solutions. Alternatively we might consider re-evaluating the problem again as sometimes we may not
                            find a solution because the problem definition is not well defined or self-contradictory.
                        </p>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5><strong>Planning The Next Course Of Action (Next Step)</strong></h5>
                        <p>
                            This section of the process is where we write down what we are going to do next. Now that we have
                            a potential solution or solutions we need to decide how we will make the solution happen. This
                            will involve people us various things at various times in the future and then confirming that
                            they have been carried out as planned. This stage ensures that the valuable thinking that has
                            gone into solving the problem becomes reality. This series of Next Steps is the logical step to
                            physically solving the problem.
